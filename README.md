Dijkstra's Algorithm

Simple Dijkstra's Algorithm calculation that allows you to build your own node system.

* 1: Add Node

  Adds a node, no duplicates allowed.
  
* 2: Add Edge
  
  Adds an edge. An edge called "AB" is the same as "BA". Undirected.
  
* 3: Remove Node
  
  Removes a node and all its edges completely.
  
* 4: Remove Edge
  
  Removes an edge connection without removing the node.
  
* 5: Display Nodes
  
  Shows available nodes.

* 6: Display Edges
  
  Displays nodes, and their edge connections (without weight)
  
* 7: View Matrixes
  
  Node Matrixes for nodes, edges, and weights.
  
* 8: Import File (binary)
  
  Imports a file that you first must save.
  
* 9: Export File (Save)
  
  Exports a binary file you can load. Create a "save" folder if it doesn't already exist.
  
* 10: Calculate Dijkstra's Algorithm
  
  Calculates the shortest distances between two nodes if they do exist.
  
* 0: Exit
  
  Ends the program.
